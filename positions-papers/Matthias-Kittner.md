Submission to the SATURN 2019 workshop: Architecture Island, May 6th, 2019 in Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

_Disclaimer: the views expressed in this position paper are my own and do not reflect those of my employer._

# Human factor and communication
* Not on Island
* Umwelt einbeziehen (stakeholders + developers)
* Sprache sprechen, guter Kommunikator
* 50% communication
* people develop software

# Vision
* Vision carrier, Imagination + beschreiben können
* Präambel eines Gesetzes als Auslegungshilfe
* Abstract in many levels
* Compare with life
* See principles everywhere
* Step back to reinvent

# Humility
* Throw away wrong stuff
* Curiosity
* Will to learn
* Flexibility: Balance between humility and assertiveness

# Craftmanship
* Patterns and Antipatterns
* Technology stack, set of tools and processes in context

# Decisions
* Identification
* Right timing
* Trade-off vs. perfectionism
* Able to drive and decide (or decide who decides)
* Clear, understandable and justified

Finally and to be honest I would add, a little bit of luck helps to find the right piece, to decide for the best solution or to set on the right technology. This applies like for an entrepreneur, engineer or scientist.

Those are some of my thoughts I would like to contribute to our discussion in this workshops. Looking forward to be part of it and curious what we will find out and condense.
