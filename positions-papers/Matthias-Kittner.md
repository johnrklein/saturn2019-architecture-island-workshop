Submission to the SATURN 2019 workshop: Architecture Island, May 6th, 2019 in Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

_Disclaimer: the views expressed in this position paper are my own and do not reflect those of my employer._

Those are some of my thoughts I would like to contribute to our discussion in this workshops. Looking forward to be part of it and curious what we will find out and condense.

# Human factor and communication
The software architect doesn't live on an Island.

On one side he needs to involve the customer, the stakeholders who give the requirements and have expectations. He needs to be able to speak their language, read between the lines and get the vision or understanding of the system to build even better that some of those stakeholders. He needs to be able help them to understand limitations and implications.

On the other hand he needs to understand and speak the language of developers and the people who will implement or further work on the results he is delivering. He needs to be able to communicate the vision, structure and details of the design.

I believe 50% of the architects job is to communicate. So he needs to be good at it.

# Vision
The software architect is the carrier of the vision which he needs to understand. He needs to have the imagination how the system will look like and be able to describe this in a model.

He is the one who defines the abstract principles for the design like a preamble to a law. Those principles will be the guidelines for detailing the architecture (by other architects or developers) afterwards and keeping consistency with the vision.

He is able to abstract everything in many levels, sees principles and analogies in several areas of life and is able to step back and reinvent.

# Humility and assertiveness
The software architect is able to question and challenge himself or be challenged by others. He understands that he doesn't know everything and is able to throw away wrong models. He is curious and willing to learn.

On the other hand he needs to find a balance with a kind of assertiveness so that the vision and the principles of the design are homogeneous.

# Craftmanship and experiences
The software architect needs to have experience and grow in it. He will be unable to read the person sized tower of paper but it is necessary to be competent in the craftmanship of software architecture. So a growing and continuously updated knowing of patterns, antipatterns, technology stack, set of tools and processes is necessary. I don't know what is 'essential', what is 'enough'. The feeling to fear that I might not know enough can sometimes frustrate. Whereas the joy of continuous learning and growing balances this out.

# Decisions
The software architect is able to identify where decisions need to be made. He finds also the right timing: not to decide too early (and unnecessarily limit future opportunities) nor delay necessary decisions (and with it the whole project or even worse that a decision is made implicitely by accident).

He is able to find trade-offs and is not bound by perfectionism. He drives decicions and decides (or decides who will decide). The decisions are clear, understandable and justified.

# Finally
Finally and to be honest I would add, a little bit of luck helps to find the right piece, to decide for the best solution or to set on the right technology. This applies like for an entrepreneur, engineer or scientist.
