# Bryan Osterkamp - Architecture Island Position Paper

Ahoy matey!  I'm super excited to be joining everyone on Architecture Island!

This will be a very tricky packing job.  I'm normally a very thorough packer, so I'll have to keep it succinct.  

Let's see, what to pack first...

## My favorite architecture book by far is
* Software Architecture in Practice 3rd Edition

### Other notable books that I would say are must haves...
* 12 Essential Skills for Software Architects
* DevOps: A Software Architect's Perspective

Oh, and perhaps the most important thing of all, that I don't have to pack is my collective knowledge and experience over the past 15+ years.  One can't forget that learning lessons the hard way is perhaps one of the best teachers of all.  There is nothing like being in the midst of a problem and having to claw your way out of it.  The mentors that I have had over the years have also passed along quite a bit of knowledge.

### Other important things to pack:
* Humility
* Trust
* Curiousity
* A desire to learn

### What not to pack
Perhaps even more important would be things not to pack.

* Arrogance
* Historical bias (assuming something that worked in the past must work now, or something that didn't work in the past won't work now... even if it is a completely different situation or context)

## My Philosophy

### The early days (3-5 years ago)
My philosophy as an architect has changed over the past 5+ years that I have been an architect.  I recently found a theory called the Dunning-Kruger effect:(https://i0.wp.com/digitalwellbeing.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/dunning-kruger-effect.png?zoom=2&resize=2010%2C1340&ssl=1) that describes my journey very well.

Wikipedia describes this effect as follows: 
> In the field of psychology, the Dunningâ€“Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is.

When I first became an architect, I really didn't know that much as it relates to architecture.  Most of my philosophy came from on the job training or learning by fire.  Therefore, my approach reflected that.  I didn't have formal training in architecture, so my philosophy was do what felt right and had worked before.  I also used my "spidey sense" to know if an approach just didn't "feel right."  This actually suited me pretty well.  The first part of the Dunning-Kruger effect is when someone's confidence is much higher than their competence.   I was making decisions to the best of my ability, but not realizing that I still had much to learn.  The next part of the graph shows that as my competence increased, I started realizing that I really didn't know as much as there was to know, so I dropped into "imposter syndrome" which means even though I did actually know a lot, I felt out of my league and felt very much incompetent.  

### Recent days 
Now, I realize I still have a lot to learn, but through continuous learning (including reading the books mentioned above), I felt much more confidence.  I've learned that I am not the smartest person in the room (nor do I need to be).  I learned it is better to ask questions, than to dictate direction.  By asking questions and having curiousity, it allows my team to be able to explore ideas and grow in their skills by me not squashing any idea contrary to mine.  By having curiousity, I also get a chance to hear out other ideas that are not my own.

Another thing that I have learned (and I've actually blogged about - https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/software-infrastructure-freeway-bryan-osterkamp/) is to provide the freedom of choice to others as an enterprise architect.  I don't setup a rigid architecture, but allow for developers and testers to do what makes sense, while still falling in line with architecture standards.
